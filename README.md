Hello and welcome to my SQL portfolio! I am an experienced professional in the accessibility field, with nearly 9 years dedicated to ensuring that entertainment and critical information are accessible to audiences of all abilities.

In my role, I have developed a deep expertise in accessibility tools, particularly for the deaf and hard of hearing. This expertise extends to my SQL projects, where I utilize data to create and improve accessibility solutions. This portfolio showcases SQL projects that mirror the type of work I do professionally, demonstrating my ability to manage and analyze data effectively. The projects illustrate how I leverage SQL to develop impactful and insightful solutions in the realm of accessibility.

Feel free to explore my work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to collaborate!
